Title: Video Rental System (Version 1.0) by Jessie Panerio
Date Submitted: June 6, 2005

Description: This application is an old program of mine that I've created way back ago when i was still learning ADO Programming. I didnt include the program on Returned Items with cases (e.g. Disc returned because it did not play due to deep scratches on its surface or in other words damage disc) because it was damage and I was not able to recover it when my Hardisk malfunction. The Codes are messy and long and lots of form are used but i hope this program can somewhat help others who are starting to learn ADO Programming.
